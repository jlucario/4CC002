        <p class= "p">Halo is a science fiction video game franchise created by Bungie and owned and published by Microsoft      Game Studios. The series centers on the interstellar war between humanity and a theocratic alliance of aliens known as the      Covenant. The Covenant worship an ancient civilization known as the Forerunners, who perished in combat with the parasites      known as the Flood. The main trilogy of games center on the experiences of the Master Chief, John-117, a cybernetically     -enhanced human super-soldier, and his artificial intelligence (AI) companion, Cortana. In this setting, the term "Halo"      refers to Halo megastructures: large, habitable ringed structures, similar to the Orbitals in Iain M Banks' Culture novels,      or to smaller versions of Larry Niven's Ringworld.        
        </p>           
        <p class= "p">The series has been praised as being among the best first-person shooters on a video game console, and      are considered the Microsoft Xbox's "killer app". This has led to the term "Halo killer" being used to describe console games      that aspire, or are considered, to be better than Halo. Fueled by the success of Halo: Combat Evolved, and immense marketing      campaigns from publisher Microsoft, its sequels went on to break various sales records. Halo 3 sold more than US$170 million      worth of copies in the first twenty-four hours of release, breaking the record set by Halo 2 three years prior. Halo: Reach, in      turn, broke the record set by Halo 3, selling $200 million USD worth of copies on its first day. The games have sold over 34      million copies worldwide, and all Halo merchandise has grossed more than $1.7 billion.
