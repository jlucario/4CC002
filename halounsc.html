      <h3 class= "subheading">Master Chief</h3>           
      <p class= "p">Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, commonly referred to as Master Chief, is the protagonist and main playable character      in the Halo trilogy. The character is voiced by Chicago disc jockey Steve Downes. One of the last of the SPARTAN-II      supersoldiers still in active service (one of the few survivors of the Fall of Reach), the Master Chief inspires awe and fear      in the alien Covenant, who see him as a demon. Assisted by the artificial intelligence Cortana, he prevents the firing of      Installation 04 in Halo: Combat Evolved, an event which the player is told would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy.     Bungie staff member Joseph Staten noted that until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not paid any attention to how to make     people want to play in the world. "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," he said, "in terms of how people react      to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor."       
      </p>           
      <h3 class= "subheading">Cortana</h3>           
      <p class= "p">Cortana, voiced in the games by Jen Taylor, is the artificial intelligence (AI) who assists the Master Chief throughout      Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, and Halo 3. She is one of many "smart" AIs, and is based on Dr. Halsey; the nature of her      programming means she will eventually "think" herself to death after a lifespan of about seven years. Her actions during      Halo: Combat Evolved help prevent the activation of the Halo installation. She escapes Halo along with the Master Chief in a      fighter, and is instrumental in helping the UNSC survivors capture the Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice during the events of      Halo: First Strike. During Halo 2 Cortana is put in charge of the MAC (Magnetic Accelerator Cannon) defense platform Cairo over      Earth when the Covenant attack; she then follows the Chief on In Amber Clad to Delta Halo, where she further assists in      intelligence work. Cortana stays behind on High Charity to detonate In Amber Clad's engines in case Halo is activated. She      subsequently falls into the clutches of the Gravemind. In Halo 3, Cortana is rescued by the Master Chief from High Charity and      aids him in activating the Halo ring under construction on the Ark. After narrowly escaping from Halo's destructive blast, she      and Master Chief are stranded in space, awaiting rescue.       
      </p>           
      <h3 class= "subheading">Avery Johnson</h3>           
      <p class= "p">Sergeant Major Johnson is a Marine who leads human forces against Covenant and Flood assaults throughout the Halo series.      The character is voiced by David Scully. Johnson and a few other Marines survive the destruction of Installation 04 and are      rescued by Cortana and the Master Chief during the novel Halo: First Strike. Johnson plays a much larger role in Halo 2,      joining forces with the Arbiter to stop Tartarus from activating Installation 05. In Halo 2, he is awarded the Colonial      Cross for his heroic actions, and leads UNSC forces to drive the Covenant from New Mombasa, Kenya after the Covenant take      the city during the events of the game. In Halo 3: ODST, Johnson is seen asking an Engineer what the Covenant want in New      Mombasa and the Engineer lit Johnson's cigar. In Halo 3, the Forerunner construct 343 Guilty Spark kills him when Johnson      tries to activate the incomplete Halo at the Ark. Johnson is the sole character featured in The Halo Graphic Novel story,      "Breaking Quarantine", which details Johnson's escape from the Flood in Halo: Combat Evolved, and a main character in the 2007     novel Halo: Contact Harvest. Johnson was said to have an immunity to the Flood although this is debatable.

      <h3 class= "subheading">Jacob Keyes</h3>           
      <p class= "p">Captain Jacob Keyes (voiced by Pete Stacker) is a captain in the UNSC who appears in Halo: Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, its      novelization, Halo: The Flood, Halo: The Cole Protocol, and Halo: The Fall of Reach. His first chronological appearance is in      Fall of Reach, where, as a young Lieutenant, he accompanies Doctor Catherine Halsey on her mission to screen possible SPARTAN-II     Project subjects. In 2534, Lieutenant Keyes plays a pivotal role in saving a million insurrectionists' lives from Covenant      forces. By 2552, midway through Fall of Reach Keyes is commander of the Iroquois, a UNSC destroyer. Keyes is promoted      to Captain after he singlehandedly defeats four Covenant ships about to attack a human colony by performing a maneuver known      as the "Keyes Loop". When the Iroquois is recalled to the human bastion Reach, a Covenant tracking device alerts the      Covenant to the planet's existence, and proceed to attack the colony. As the planet is glassed by the Covenant, Keyes follows      Cole Protocol, which leads his new ship Pillar of Autumn to Halo. There, Keyes leads a guerrilla insurgency against the      Covenant, until he is captured and assimilated by the parasitic Flood in Halo's ninth mission, the eponymous Keyes. His      daughter is Miranda Keyes. He also appeared in the Recent Halo: Reach at the end of the last mission, this is when he retrieves      Cortana from Noble six, and tells him "good luck, Spartan".       
      </p>           
      <h3 class= "subheading">Miranda Keyes</h3>           
      <p class= "p">Commander Miranda Keyes is the daughter of Jacob Keyes and Catherine Halsey whom she lived with in her younger years. Halsey      and Miranda had a falling out in which she changed her last name (then Halsey) to her father's name (Keyes). Miranda appears in      Halo 2 and Halo 3. At the beginning of Halo 2, Keyes is present at an awards ceremony on board the Cairo defense platform above      Earth to accept a medal posthumously for her father. Soon after, a Covenant fleet launches an attack on Earth, and Commander      Keyes links up with the rest of the fleet aboard the In Amber Clad and assists in the defense of New Mombasa, Kenya. When the      Prophet of Regret retreats from Earth, Keyes orders the In Amber Clad to follow; this results in the discovery of      Installation 05, another Halo. Keyes, along with Johnson and a squad of Marines, head for Halo's library in order to retrieve      the activation Index and prevent the ring's activation while the Master Chief assassinates the Prophet of Regret; in the process,      she and Johnson are captured by the Brute Chieftain Tartarus. As a "Reclaimer," only she or another human can insert the Index      into Halo's control panel, and Tartarus attempts to make her to do this. When the Arbiter tries to stop the firing, Tartarus      forces Keyes to insert the Index, initiating Halo's firing sequence. After the Arbiter engages and kills Tartarus, Keyes      successfully removes the Index and prevents Halo from activating, but inadvertently causes all remaining Halo installations to      enter standby mode, enabling the remote firing of these installations from The Ark. In Halo 3, Miranda Keyes returns to      Earth and leads the pursuit of the Prophet of Truth through the portal he creates using the artifact buried under New Mombasa,      which leads to the Ark. When Sergeant Johnson is captured by the Covenant to activate the installation, she attempts to rescue      him; Keyes is killed when Truth shoots her in the back

      <h3 class= "subheading">Catherine Halsey</h3>           
      <p class= "p">Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey is a civilian scientist in the UNSC. She appears in the books Halo: The Fall of Reach,      Halo: First Strike, and Halo: Ghosts of Onyx, as well as the Halo Legends shorts "Homecoming" and "The Package" and      Halo: Reach. In the fiction, a flash clone of her brain tissue is the basis for the construction of the "smart" AI Cortana.     As the creator of the SPARTAN-II Project, she is responsible for 75 of the 150 Spartan children, along with their training      and the subsequent death of 30 due to the dangerous augmentation process. She is viewed by the SPARTAN-IIs as a "mother"      figure, and addresses each soldier by their name rather than designation, even when the spartans are fully suited in their      armor. Halsey justifies her actions through her belief that the suffering of a few is acceptable for the benefit of many.      Sergeant Johnson, however, unknowingly causes Halsey to rethink her position, and she decides to "save each and every member      of humanity beginning with herself" during Halo: First Strike. Dr. Halsey hijacks a shuttle for her own private mission to the      planet Onyx; there, she assists in deciphering the surrounding Forerunner glyphs on the planet and leads the surviving Spartan-IIs      and Spartan-IIIs to a Dyson Sphere at the heart of Onyx. She is later revealed to be the mother of Miranda Keyes.
