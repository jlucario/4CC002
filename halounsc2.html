      <h3 class= "subheading">Terrence Hood</h3>    
      <p class= "p">Fleet Admiral Lord Terrence Hood (voiced by Ron Perlman) first appears in the novel, Halo: First Strike. He is a member of the      UNSC Security Committee and is the Chief of Naval Operations. He greatly respects the Spartans, not only because of their record,      but because they have saved his life on two occasions. When Halo 2 begins Admiral Hood presents the Master Chief, Sergeant      Johnson, and Miranda Keyes with medals aboard the Cairo Station. In Halo: Ghosts of Onyx, Hood receives an urgent message by      Dr. Halsey requesting for him to send Spartans to assist her, and obliges by ordering Fred-104, Will-043, and Linda-058 to Onyx.      In Halo 3, Hood is in overall command of Earth's defense with Commander Miranda Keyes reporting directly to him. He accepts the      need for humanity to ally with the Elites, but is not entirely happy about it. He leads the remaining human naval forces in an      attack on the Prophet of Truth's dreadnought, but the attack fails when the Forerunner artifact under New Mombasa activates,      creating a portal to the Ark. When the Master Chief, Keyes, and several Elite and human forces choose to follow the Prophet of      Truth through the portal, he decides to stay behind to make a final stand on Earth. At the end of the game, he commemorates a      small monument to the war and the sacrifices it involved.

      <h3 class= "subheading">Franklin Mendez</h3>    
      <p class= "p">Senior Chief Petty Officer Franklin Mendez is the SPARTAN-II's trainer on Reach during the early events of Halo: The Fall of      Reach. He provides his trainees with excellent weapons and physical lessons, as well as tactical and mental training. He is not      very talkative, but possesses a brilliant mind for warfare, and this is reflected in the Master Chief's abilities. He is described     as neither tall nor muscular, with close-cut hair that has a dash of gray at the temples. He leaves the Spartans after the      discovery of the Covenant to train the next batch of Spartans, and is recruited by Colonel Ackerson to assist Lieutenant      Commander Kurt Ambrose (Spartan-II Kurt-051) with training the SPARTAN-III supersoldiers at the secret world of Onyx after a few      years of combat duty (receiving two Purple Hearts in the process). During Ghosts of Onyx he is sealed inside the Forerunner      Dyson Sphere at the heart of the planet with the remaining Spartan survivors.

      <h3 class= "subheading">James Ackerson</h3>    
      <p class= "p">Colonel James Ackerson is a high ranking officer in the Office of Naval Intelligence, who has seen many years of service and      has survived several battles with the Covenant. Such is his influence that he dominates the Security Committee and can talk down      most higher-ranking officers without fear of reprisal. Due to the competition between Ackerson and other departments, most      notably Section Three and the SPARTAN-II project, Ackerson harbors a strong resentment toward his opponents and toward the      Spartans in particular. He does eventually convince the top members of ONI to approve his SPARTAN-III Program. In Halo: The Fall      of Reach, he attempts to sabotage the MJOLNIR Mark V testing process by using ordnance far above the established guidelines,      including Lotus anti-tank mines, a full squad of ODSTs ordered to shoot to kill, automated gun turrets, and an airstrike. However,      Cortana retaliated by forging a letter requesting a reassignment to the front lines as well as planting evidence of illicit      activities in his bank records. In Halo: First Strike, it is revealed that Ackerson manages to weasel his way out of Cortana's      mess, In the limited comic series Halo: Uprising Ackerson falls into the hands of Covenant orbiting Mars and is slated to      die before Ackerson tells his interrogator about a "key" to Earth. The "key" is in fact a fabrication by Ackerson to save a      relative living in Cleveland, Ohio. After the Brutes holding Ackerson prisoner are informed that no such key exists, Ackerson is      beheaded.

      <h3 class= "subheading">Wallace Jenkins</h3>    
      <p class= "p">Private Wallace A. Jenkins is one of many UNSC forces that survived the initial Covenant attack in Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo:      Contact Harvest reveals that the soldier was a member of the colony Harvest's defense militia, where his family is killed. In Halo:      The Flood, Jenkins assists in defending the human stronghold under the command of Major Antonio Silva. He is also part of an assault      team led by Sergeant Avery Johnson and Captain Jacob Keyes, sent to recover a Covenant arms cache during Halo: Combat Evolved. The      team is overwhelmed by the Flood, leaving the entire squad except Sergeant Johnson infected and resulting in the eventual death of      Captain Keyes. In the video game, the Master Chief recovers Jenkins' helmet, and reviews the recording of the mission that it      contained, introducing the Flood to the player through the Marine's eyes. In Halo, the fate of the Marine is left unknown. Halo:      The Flood reveals the fate of Jenkins; the Private is transformed into a Flood combat form along with the rest of his squad, but      he is able to exercise a certain degree of control over the infection, due to the mind of the parasite being weakened by its long      hibernation. He uses this limited control in an attempt to end his own life, charging at UNSC Marines in the hope that they      would shoot him. Instead he is captured, as a live specimen for study. He is brought aboard the Covenant cruiser Truth and      Reconciliation as part of a mission under Orbital Drop Shock Trooper Major Silva to capture a Covenant vessel and return it to      Earth intact. Jenkins successfully convinces Lieutenant Melissa McKay, that such a mission would spread the Flood to Earth, and      Jenkins dies with the other human troops on the vessel as it crashed into Halo.

      <h3 class= "subheading">Spartans</h3>    
      <p class= "p">Conceived by Halsey, the SPARTAN-II project was secretly commissioned to create an elite corps of supersoldiers who could stem      rebellion in the UNSC colonies; these soldiers became the best weapon against the alien Covenant when war broke out. While Master      Chief is the hero of the trilogy, other soldiers play a significant role in the novels, Halo Legends and the prequel games Halo      Wars and Halo: Reach. In an effort to raise morale as the war continued to sour for humanity, the existence of the SPARTAN-II      Program is disclosed to the general public. The Spartans become heroes and veritable legends; in order to maintain public      confidence that the war is going well, Spartans are never listed as killed, only as MIA or Wounded in Action (WIA).The most      distinctive element of the Spartans is their special MJOLNIR armor. The Mark V armor from Halo: Combat Evolved was ranked      third of Casualty Gamer's "Top 10 Bodysuits", with the author commenting "It’s one of the most recognizable symbols from any      game, and is literally the image of the franchise’s legendary hero, Master Chief." The "Recon" armor of Halo 3's multiplayer      was also rated tenth of Machinima.com's "Top 10 Video Game Armor", as well as Maxim's. Inspired by the Halo video game series,      Troy Hurtubise, known for his anti-bear suits, developed a real counterpart to the MJOLNIR battle armor, named the Trojan. The      suit is functional and its capabilities were inspired by those present in the video games versions of the armor. The armor's      features include a system that purifies air powered by solar panels located in the helmet, equipment for weapon transportation,      a recording system, emergency illumination and a transponder that can be activated if the wearer is in serious jeopardy. The      armor offers protection against attacks with knives, blunt objects and small explosions and is bulletproof. Hurtubise expressed      that he is able to improve this design for use in the military for a price of 2,000 dollars per piece. Non-functional replicas of      the MJOLNIR armor have also been created by hobbyists; a Spike TV pre-Halo 3 special profiled some of these dedicated fans.
