      <h2 class= "subheading">The Forerunners</h2>        
      <p class= "p">The Forerunners are a long-lost species which are first cryptically mentioned in Halo: Combat Evolved. Little is          revealed about the Forerunners in the games, but for unknown reasons they consider humanity to be "special"; humanity          is thus the only race which can reclaim the keys which activate the Halo network. According to the official backstory          to the series, the Forerunners came to power after the extinction of an even more ancient race, known to them as the          Precursors, and formed a galaxy wide empire more than 3 billion years before the events of the main Halo story arc.         The Forerunners took it upon themselves to protect all life in the galaxy, but were threatened by the parasitic Flood.         The Forerunners took action, but the parasite was unstoppable. A group of Forerunners conceived a plan to stop the Flood          once and for all, building an installation known as the Ark that created seven ring-shaped megastructures called "Halos".          The Halo Array, when activated, would destroy all sentient life within range—depriving the Flood of its food. After waiting         as long as they could, and travelling the galaxy to collect species from planets, which would later be used to "re-seed"          the galaxy, the Forerunners activated the Array and vanished. Although the parasite's spread across the galaxy was          halted, the Forerunners paid a terrible price as they, and all sentient life capable of sustaining the Flood in the galaxy,          were annihilated. The Covenant worship the Forerunners as deities and relentlessly search for Forerunner relics. The reason          for the Forerunner's disappearance is revealed in Halo: Combat Evolved, when the artificial intelligence Cortana enters one          of the Halo's computer networks and learns the true purpose of the Halos.

      <h3 class= "subheading">343 Guilty Spark</h3>        
      <p class= "p">343 Guilty Spark (voiced by Tim Dadabo) is the Monitor of Installation 04. He is first encountered by the player at the          end of Halo's sixth level, "343 Guilty Spark", after the Flood breach containment. He enlists the help of the Master Chief,          whom he calls a "Reclaimer", to activate Halo's defenses, neglecting to tell the Master Chief that Halo's "defenses"          would cause the destruction of all sentient life in the galaxy. He attempts to stop the Master Chief and Cortana from          destroying the Pillar of Autumn, and thereby destroying Halo, but is ultimately thwarted when the ship explodes and          destabilizes his ring. Discovered in the system by the Covenant, Spark, known as an "Oracle" to the Prophets, eventually          informs the Covenant Hierarchs of how to access Installation 05 in Halo 2. In Halo 3 Spark allies with the humans and Elites;          since his installation has been destroyed and he has no more orders, Spark decides to help the Master Chief. Leading the Chief          across the Ark, Guilty Spark discovers a new, uncompleted Halo, which is being built to replace Installation 04. Guilty Spark          is ecstatic, but when Sergeant Johnson prepares to fire the new Halo to stop the Flood—a process that would destroy the          incomplete ring and damage the Ark—Spark goes berserk, refusing to let the Reclaimers destroy "his" ring. He is          subsequently destroyed by the Master Chief with a Spartan Laser, but Sergeant Johnson is fatally wounded in the fight.

      <h2 class= "subheading">The Flood</h2>        
      <p class= "p">The Flood is a parasite which is driven by a desire to infect or kill all sentient life it encounters. The Flood first          appears in Halo: Combat Evolved, when the Covenant release some captured specimens from stasis on Installation 04; the          parasite spreads and threatens to escape the ring, until the Master Chief destabilizes the installation with a massive          explosion. Since then, the Flood have made appearances in Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo Wars, as well as Halo: The Flood, and          Halo Graphic Novel. The Flood were added early in the game development stage of Halo: Combat Evolved, and life of Halo was          specifically tailored to increasing the surprise of the Flood's sudden appearance, halfway through the first game. At one          point, Halo featured large numbers of terrestrial dinosaur-like creatures, but Bungie felt the presence of other native          species would dilute the impact of the Flood and removed them.

      <h3 class= "subheading">Gravemind</h3>        
      <p class= "p">Gravemind is one of the primary antagonists in the Halo series. The Gravemind is a large, sentient creature of Flood          origin, created by the parasite to serve as its central intelligence once a critical biomass has been achieved. It was          introduced during the events of Halo 2, where the creature saves both the Master Chief and Arbiter from their deaths,          bringing the two face to face in the bowels of Delta Halo. Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the "sacred rings" are          actually weapons of last resort; a fact the Master Chief confirms. In order to stop Halo from being fired, Gravemind          teleports the Master Chief and Arbiter to separate locations, but also uses them as a distraction; Gravemind infects the          human ship In Amber Clad, and invades the Covenant city of High Charity. Capturing Cortana, Gravemind brings High Charity          to the Ark in an effort to stop the High Prophet of Truth from activating the Halo network. Although the Master Chief destroys          High Charity, Gravemind attempts to rebuild himself on Halo. When Halo is activated, Gravemind is resigned to his fate,          determined that the activation of the ring will only slow, not stop, the progress of the Flood.
