    <div id="content">    <h2 class= "title">The Covenant</h2>        <h3 class= "subheading">The High Prophets</h3>                  
      <p class= "p">High Prophets, or Hierarchs, are the supreme leaders of the theocratic Covenant. Upon assuming office, each Hierarch      picks a new regnal name from a list of names of former Hierarchs, similar to the practice of some Orthodox Patriarchs.      In Halo 2, there are shown to be only three; the Prophets of Truth, Mercy, and Regret (voiced by Michael Wincott, Hamilton      Camp and Robin Atkin Downes. In addition to be seen in the first two in the "Halo" series, Regret is also seen in Halo Wars.      In Halo 2, respectively; in Halo 3, Truth is voiced by Terrence Stamp). The novel Halo: Contact Harvest reveals that these      three Prophets, originally known as the Minister of Fortitude, the Vice-Minister of Tranquility, and the Philologist,      plotted to usurp the throne of the Hierarchs; in the process, they hide the truth that humanity is descended from the Covenant      gods, the Forerunners, believing that the revelation could shatter the Covenant. During the course of Halo 2, Regret attacks      Earth, and then retreats to Delta Halo. There, he calls for reinforcements, but is killed by the Master Chief. Later, Mercy is      attacked by Flood on High Charity, and abandoned by Truth. In Halo 3: ODST, Truth is seen inspecting some Engineers around the      Forerunner construct near New Mombasa. In Halo 3, Truth also meets his demise at the hands of the Arbiter when the Prophet      attempts to activate all the Halo rings from the Ark. Preliminary designs for the Prophets, including the Hierarchs, were      done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According to The Art of Halo, the Prophets were designed to look feeble, yet sinister.      Originally, the Prophets appeared to be fused to the special hovering thrones they use for transport; even in the final      designs, the Prophets are made to be dependent on their technology. Special headdresses, stylized differently for each of the      Hierarchs, adds personality to the aliens and a regal presence.              
      </p>    <h3 class= "subheading">Arbiter</h3>                  
      <p class= "p">The Arbiter is a rank given to special Covenant Elite soldiers who undertake suicidal missions on behalf of the Hierarchs      to gain honor upon their death. They are revered amongst the Covenant for their bravery and skills. In Halo 2, the rank of      Arbiter is given to the disgraced former Supreme Commander of the Fleet of Particular Justice. Under his watch the Ascendant      Justice was captured by the Master Chief and Installation 04 was destroyed. Rather than killing him, the Prophets allow the      Commander to become the Arbiter, and to carry on his missions as the "Blade of the Prophets". Eventually, the Arbiter     rebels against the Prophets and joins his fellow Elites in siding with humanity and stopping the Halo array from firing.      Originally to be named "Dervish", the Arbiter was a playable character intended to be a major plot twist by Bungie. Reception      to the character was lukewarm, with critics alternatively praising the added dimension brought by the Arbiter as well as      complaining about having to play as the alien. In Halo Wars, set 20 years before Halo: Combat Evolved, a second Arbiter is      shown, possibly as the last to wear the armor before the more recognized character. He is described as a "mean guy," lead      designer David Pottinger comparing him to Darth Vader. The second Arbiter is the main antagonist of Halo Wars. He leads the      Covenant to the fleet of Forerunner ships as well as capturing Ellen Anders in order to do so. After a fight he is killed by      Sergeant Forge and a Spartan rolls his body off a cliff.              
      </p>    <h3 class= "subheading">Rtas 'Vadum</h3>                  
      <p class= "p">Making his debut in Halo 2, the Special Ops Commander is never named in the game itself, leading to the unofficial nickname      of "Half-Jaw" by fans, due to the missing mandibles on the left side of his face. With the release of the Halo Graphic Novel,      however, the character was finally named in the story Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor as Rtas 'Vadumee. The character is      voiced by Robert Davi. 'Vadum, originally 'Vadumee before the Covenant Civil War, is a veteran Covenant Elite and the second      most prominent Elite character in the series after the Arbiter. The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor explains how he loses      his mandible; he is injured after fighting one of his friends, who was infected by the Flood. During the early events of      Halo 2, 'Vadum serves as a messenger between the Hierarchs and the Elite Council, as he is seen relaying messages between the      two parties in the Prophets' chamber; when the Elites split from the Covenant, 'Vadum joins his brethren in fighting the      Brutes. In Halo 3, 'Vadum is Shipmaster of the flagship Shadow of Intent, and supports Cortana's plan to follow Truth to      the Ark. Along with the Arbiter, 'Vadum leaves Earth to return to the Elite's homeworld with the end of the war.              
      </p>    <h3 class= "subheading">Tartarus</h3>                  
      <p class= "p">Tartarus (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is the Chieftain of the Brutes, easily recognized by his white hair,      distinctive mohawk, and massive gravity hammer known as the "Fist of Rukt". Rough, arrogant, and disdainful of the Elites,      Tartarus is completely dedicated to the Prophets' salvific "Great Journey". Halo: Contact Harvest reveals that Tartarus became      Chieftain after killing his uncle (Maccabeus) and seizing the Chieftain's weapon. Tartarus makes his first appearance in the      novel Halo: First Strike, as one of the first Brutes allowed into the chamber of the High Prophet of Truth. In Halo 2,      Tartarus acts as an agent of the Prophets, branding the Arbiter for his failures. The Chieftain later appears when the Arbiter      tries to retrieve the activation index of Delta Halo. On the Prophets' orders, Tartarus takes the Index and pushes the Arbiter      to what was intended to be his death in a deep chasm. Tartarus heads to the control room of Halo with the Index in order to      activate Halo, but is confronted by the Arbiter. Blind to the Prophets' deception about the Great Journey, Tartarus activates      the ring; the Brute is ultimately killed by the coordinated efforts of the Arbiter with the help of Sergeant Major Johnson,      successfully preventing the firing of Delta Halo. Designs for Tartarus began after the basic shape and design of the common      Brutes was complete. Artist Shi Kai Wang added small but distinctive changes to Tartarus' armor and mane in order to      distinguish the Chieftain from the other Brutes. The visual design of the Chieftains was later modified for Halo 3, with      the seasoned warriors sporting more elaborate headdresses and shoulder pads. In a review of the character, UGO Networks      noted that whereas the Elites "are a precision scalpel", Tartarus was a "baseball bat" that smashes everything in its path.
